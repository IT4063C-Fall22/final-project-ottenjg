    "What is the coorelation education has to rising or falling crime rates in Cincinnati?\n",

    "I would still be using geographical charts and models like heat maps. I would use line graphs to compare education level/investment amounts to crime rates. Bar charts would be useful as well. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "i will use location data to show maps (heat maps). I will answer the question by showing a connection between crime and education using location data. I will see how scores for schools could be impacted, and will try to see if improving school performance can lower crime rates."
